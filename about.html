<p>
Why the name Beautiful Mi?  My korean first name is Young Mi.  In Chinese, Mi is from the word beautiful.  So I am Beautiful Mi.
I have tons of passions and I just can’t stick to one hobby.  I am not just a crafter... It’s like I have to be an expert on everything! I am not joking. Some of my favorite passions and hobbies are.. cooking (going to culinary school does has it’s benefits), baking(have to be in a mood), reading(which i need to do more book reviews), makeup(I need to start my youtube channel. haha. tutorials anyone?), sewing(totally want to start my own doggie clothes line), bartending(anyone want to hire me?), arranging flowers(I can do your wedding), basketball (I love the Hawks, maybe I'll add the Pacers again that I am in Indy), couponing (only been a year (no… I am not a stockpiler anymore), using oils (Youngliving anyone?)  and so much more….

Fav Books: Bible, Girl with a pearl earring, Water for Elephants
Fav. TV shows: The Voice, Game of Thrones, Lie to me, Mad Men (behind), Dexter, Top chef, Project Runway
Fav. Movies: Father of Lights, Lord of the Rings

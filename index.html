    <p>There is something about handmade card that has become one of my passions and love.  I love the process of making each one as I color, cut, and put together something I designed.  Its an outpouring of my heart on a piece of paper that I can share with others. Welcome to my page.  My name is Young Mi and I love crafting. I first got into crafting in 2010.  I was searching the web for ideas on how to make a homemade card.  I came across beautiful handmade cards and I was obsessed about how I can make the cards myself. New to crafting?  Here are some helpful information to help you get started:

      All you need is your imagination to get started.  Have an idea for a card? Take out a pen and start drawling.  Or... you can be like me, where I need stamps to help guide me to make my cards.

        This is jennifer McGuire.  She is a super awesome hand-made card maker.  She has a ton of techniques and her videos are super informative.  I love followering her on Instagram and seeing what new projects she comes up next.  She is a Christian, wife, mom, sister, and friend, looking to share a little kindness with the world through handmade cards and the joy of creating. You can watch her videos to inspire you to create and make your own cards. Long live snail mail!
